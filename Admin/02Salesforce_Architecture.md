# Understanding some terms

* **Multitenancy** means is that you’re sharing resources. Salesforce provides a core set of services to all our customers in the multitenant cloud. No matter the size of your business, you get access to the same computing power, data storage, and core features.

* **Metadata** is data about data.
    - Let’s think about an object like Property. When our friends at DreamHouse use Salesforce, they input and view data about properties. For example, a property can be located in Boston, cost $500,000, and have 3 bedrooms.

    - Now, imagine that on this Property record you delete Boston, $500,000, and the number 3 for bedrooms. What are you left with? You are left with the Property object along with all its empty fields, like the address field, the price field, and the number of bedrooms field. These fields are metadata.

    - Now, let’s think about metadata in a bigger context. Metadata is also your page layouts, security settings, and any other customizations you’ve made to the structure of your org that collect or use your organization’s data.

    - All of these standard and custom configurations, functionality, and code in your org are metadata. Part of the reason you can move so fast on the platform is that Salesforce knows how to store and serve you that metadata immediately after you create it. Because metadata gives structure to your org, it helps you know whether to enter a price vs a number, it can reference an address using geolocation on a map, or collect information about a contact that can be related to multiple objects.

* **API**-The application programming interface (API) allows different pieces of software to connect to each other and exchange information.

# What Is AppExchange?

You’re probably comfortable with the idea of app stores. Whether you’re downloading apps on your phone, tablet, computer, or other device, you have to download and install apps to make the most of your technology.

Salesforce is the same way. Salesforce has a community of partners that use the flexibility of the Salesforce platform to build amazing apps and other solutions that anyone can use. These offerings are available (some for free, some at a cost) for installation on AppExchange.
