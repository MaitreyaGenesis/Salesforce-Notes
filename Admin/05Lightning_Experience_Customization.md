# What do Compact Layouts do?

- Compact layouts control which fields your users see in the highlights panel at the top of a record.<br>
- They also control the fields that appear in the expanded lookup card you see when you hover over a link in record details, and in the details section when you expand an activity in the activity timeline.<br>
- Compact layouts help make your team more productive by presenting them with the key record information so they can easily manage their work. <br>
- For example, show phone numbers and regions on an account. Or, show stages, amounts, and ownership fields on an opportunity. With compact layouts, you can highlight whatever your users need to see at a glance when they look at a record.<br>

# Record Pages

- You can customize and personalize many things on object record pages using a combination of the Lightning App Builder and page layouts.<br>
- Most of the pages you see in Lightning Experience, such as the Home page and record pages, are Lightning pages.<br>
- Lightning pages are a collection of components arranged in regions on the page.<br>
- You can customize the structure of the page, the position of its components, and the record detail fields it displays with the Lightning App Builder.<br>

The **Lightning App Builder** lets you:

- Control which components appear on Lightning pages
- Create custom Lightning pages for different apps and users
- Control which fields appear on record pages

The **page layout editor** lets you:

- Control which lists of related records and custom links users see
- Control which standard and custom buttons appear on records and related lists
- Control which quick actions appear on the page

Note : Activating the page makes it available to your users.

There are four options for activation.

- Make the page the org default for the object.
- Make the page the default object record page for specific Lightning apps.
- Assign the page to a combination of Lightning apps, record types, and profiles.
- Assign the page to a form factor, such as a desktop or phone.

# Custom Buttons and Links

- Custom buttons and links help you integrate Salesforce data with external URLs, applications, your company’s intranet, or other back-end office systems.
- Custom links can link to an external URL, such as www.google.com, a Visualforce page, or your company’s intranet. 
- Custom buttons can connect users to external applications, such as web pages, and launch custom links.

There are three primary types of custom buttons and links that you can create.

- List button—Appears on a related list on an object record page.
- Detail page link—Appears in the Links section of the record details on an object record page.
- Detail page button—Appears in the action menu in the highlights panel of a record page.

A **custom list button** is a button that you can add to a related list. When you create a list button for an object, you can add that button to that object’s related list when the related list appears on other objects.
